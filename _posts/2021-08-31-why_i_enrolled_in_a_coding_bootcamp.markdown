Seems a little silly to be starting this blog post now that I have reached the end but this is a great time to reflect on the journey, how far I've come and where I'm at now compared with my initial expectations when I started. 

So let's start at the beginning. At the time I had found a home buried deep in my spreadsheets, frankensteining macros in VBA to automate the reports I had to produce as an analyst and cut down the repetitive tasks so that I could focus what the data was trying to tell me. The crux of my job was to drive manufacturing process improvements using data analytics but my favorite part was building the spreadsheets - I loved pressing macro buttons and seeing a cascade of actions taking place that would take me hours to complete manually, happening in seconds. I loved infusing conditional formatting and rendering presentation-ready charts and tables. I loved identifying pain points and building useful solutions but the only tool in my kit was Excel. I even built a functional Salesforce-like CRM tool in Excel tailored specifically to the needs of our sales team - buttons and forms and even the ability to edit pre-existing entries in the original form format.

My interest in a coding bootcamp was piqued one afternoon in a product development meeting when our current process had missed a key step, jeopardizing our ability to launch, and a coworker offered to reach out to a developer to create a custom solution to track our product launch process in a self-contained app as opposed to disparate email threads and disorganized docusign folders. Before I could set about creating another opus in Excel, a friend who had just sat through the same meeting could already see the gears turning in my head. After talking about it at length he suggested I enroll in a coding bootcamp to expand my builders toolkit. 

Familiar with only the concepts of HTML and CSS, I wasn't sure I was going to have breadth of control over data that I had with Excel. But after researching a bit more and seeing students' projects, it was clear that this should be my next step. My goal with this bootcamp was to learn how to use code to create user-friendly interfaces designed to manage data and processes. 

Here's what I got out of the bootcamp: 
* Object Oriented programming - by organizing code around objects that it's supposed to represent and writing object-specific methods, we can treat information like the real-world objects it is meant to represent. 
* SQL and Backend APIs - I had a very basic understanding of SQL coming into this program as in knowing how to join tables and how that was similar to an Excel VLOOKUP function. Early on in this course, we were introduced to SQL and databases. We learned about object relationships and how to use ActiveRecord to access data through those relationships. 
* Sinatra and Rails MVCs - after learning about the underlying data, it was time to begin implementing the MVC framework and we build two self-contained projects where we created models that were representative of objects we were capturing in the data, views to render the data and controllers to allow users to communicate with the data using CRUD and RESTful routes. 
* Frontend Development with HTML and CSS - in the above mentioned projects we also styled the views that were being rendered using HTML and CSS. 
* DOM Manipulation with JavaScript, React and Redux - recognizing that what the views were rendering in the web browser is what's called the Document Object Model, we learned how to use JavaScript to interact with the DOM, giving functionality to the various buttons.
* While we had been persisting data into our databases for projects 2-4, for the last section we learned more about JavaScript libraries, particularly React and Redux, which are optimized for rendering user interfaces and updating the DOM in realtime when changes are sent to the backend.

Looking back, I can see that I have not only learned how to code and have achieved my goal of creating the type of UI that sparked this entire journey, but I have also built the vocabulary to describe the multitude of actions I was trying to implement in my little Excel universe. I'm so thrilled to have made it to the end and can't wait to be unleashed on my next development project.
